# VoidCR

VoidCR is a (WIP) server software for [CosmicReach](https://finalforeach.itch.io/cosmic-reach) that is built upon the
ideals of a reliable and easy to use API. VoidCR does not integrate with mixins and instead uses a patch based approach.
While more restrictive for plugin developers this ensures plugin compatibility and better API stability promises cross
version.

## Deprecation Schedule

The deprecation schedule goals for VoidCR are paramount to its goal of cross version compatibility. The current goal
unless sweeping internal changes occur an expected 3 version compatibility guarantee is good for an API like this.

## How To Install

Currently there are no public buildable jars for VoidCR and there won't be for the foreseeable future as this is a
massive project.

## Contributions

VoidCR contributions are welcome, however, please create an issue **ON GITHUB** regarding your idea before getting to
work the last thing that anyone wants is to dump
a ton of time into a pull request that will instantly be closed. Pull Requests will aptly be tested and reviewed before
